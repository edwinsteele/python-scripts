slashdotRssCreator.cgi: full text rss feeds from slashdot. Likely to have
  broken if slashdot has altered their front page since it was written.

instapaper-calibre.recipe: An enhanced calibre (http://calibre-ebook.com)
  recipe for converting an instapaper reading list into an ePub e-book.
  Built on the standard calibre instapaper recipe.

bookFinder.py: Performs searches for books in local libraries from a
  consistent, commandline interface. I implemented the Penrith City library
  and Blue Mountains Council Library search routines (and I'm pretty sure
  that BMCC has recently brought their interface out of the 90s and broken
  compatibility with this script).
  Requires BeautifulSoup library.
